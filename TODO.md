# Planned
1. option to block the boot process until all flatpaks have been installed

1. better ref downloads
    ```
    "flathub:(https://url.flatpakref)"
    ":(https://url.flatpak)"
    ```
1. Fix whatever is causing Issue [#29](https://github.com/GermanBread/declarative-flatpak/issues/29)
1. opt-in telemetry for "stable" branch
1. opt-out telemetry for "dev" branch
1. Move flatpak refs into the Nix store
